# DeepLearningGameModule

Good day!

In this project our goal was to build a Deep Learning Game Module. We were expected to create
an entire virtual environment that combines 3D Studio Max models and WorldViz Vizard coding.

The goal of this project was to create course curriculum module for computer science and
mathematics students.

The module had three modes of instructions:
1. Tutorial mode: to teach the concepts to the audience
2. Interaction mode: to interact with the developed environment to learn a concept. Or play an
interactive game in VR to learn the concept.
3. Feedback Mode

Several screenshots below outline what the final module looked like:
